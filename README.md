# MarkdownFS

Suppose someone were to write a FUSE filesystem that exposed Markdown files on a real filesystem as compiled HTML. This would be "useful" (??) because then you could use your web browser to look at the current rendered version of local Markdown files in your favorite web browser without having to run a separate command to convert them.
